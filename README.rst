Event Driven Robotics (Roomba) in Python
========================================

Currently a work in progress/going through heavy refactoring and
experimentation. The goal is to create a really easy to use framework for
programming robots, specifically/initially Roomba, supporting multiple devices
and external sensors.  More to come very soon.
